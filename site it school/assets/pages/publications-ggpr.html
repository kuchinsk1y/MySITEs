                On January 21, the French National Data Protection Commission (CNIL)
                announced on its website that it had fined Google for violating the 
                EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It took six months 
                for the EU countries to make a quality level-up in the amount of fines
                for non-compliance with this standard. Prior to that, the fine was 
                mainly € 20,000-30,000, with the largest fine amounting to € 400,000
                and related to a hospital in Portugal. But this precedent is interesting
                not so much the amount of the fine as the rigidity of the regulator's 
                approaches. Denis Beregovyi, Axon Partners, explains why, especially for
                Mind.
                <br>
                <p class="main-container__content-p">
                    For what? The group complaints against Google arrived at CNIL on the
                    same day that the GDPR came into force. The complainants reported that 
                    Google processed users' personal data without due cause, in particular 
                    to create personalized advertising offers.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h2>
                To the attention of Ukrainian security officers: the inspection 
                was conducted online, without searches, without seizure of servers 
                or other visible interference for business. And so it was possible.
            </h2>
            <span>
                According to the results of CNIL inspections revealed violations 
                of two requirements of the GDPR:
            </span>
            <ol>
                <li class="first-li">Transparency and awareness of users about the processing of personal data.</li>
                <li class="second-li">Lack of proper user consent for the processing of personal data for the purpose of personalizing advertising.</li>
            </ol>
            <div>
                In the case of personalization of advertising, Google was sure to 
                obtain the consent of users, because, firstly, when creating Google
                accounts, the user agrees to the Privacy Policy, and secondly, Google
                has a section "Ads personalization", where you can disable this feature.
            </div>
            <img src="../img/img-google.svg" alt="img-google" class="img-google">
            <h3>
                This is what the ad personalization settings window in your Google Account looks like
            </h3>
            <div class="content-about">
                However, CNIL does not think so, because the information about the 
                personalization of advertising is not clear enough to users. As an 
                example, the Commission claims that the relevant "Personalization" 
                window does not contain information on the full range of Google 
                services that collect and process personal data for this purpose 
                (YouTube, Google search, Play Store, Google pictures, Gmail, etc.). ),
                and therefore, the user cannot realize to what extent the data is used and
                how exactly they can be combined.
            </div>
            <h4>
                So, let's walk through the text of the CNIL decision
            </h4>
            <div class="content-h4">
                Why France and not Ireland. Google operates in Europe through a 
                legal entity in Ireland. But the case was not initiated by the 
                Irish, but by the French regulator. This is why it happened.
                <p>
                    If data processing decisions are taken anywhere outside the EU, there 
                    is a one-stop mechanism - where the complaint is received, the body 
                    considers it. Because Google's data processing center is located in 
                    the United States and the complaint was first received in France, 
                    CNIL considered it.
